Hey Spikes!

I know it has never made top tier, but I have been having major success with a 
Temur Ascendancy deck, both pre and post Oath. Basically, the deck maximizes 4+
power creatures with evasion to steamroll the opposition, packaged with cheap 
removal for early threats and sb counterspells for control and heavy removal 
match-ups. I have only been able to test post-Oath in proxy, but I have found 
the deck to do well vs. aggro, midrange, ramp, and Jeskai. So far, its only 
weaknesses have been vs. decks with heavy sacrifice removal and hand 
disruption. 

Overall, I think the creature, counterspell and removal package of Temur makes 
it an excellent color combo this standard. Sadly, the card advantage and haste 
enabling of Ascendancy makes it a vital part of the deck. And obviously it will
be rotating soon :(.

CARD BREAK DOWN

Enchantments

  * Temur Ascendancy: The all-star of this deck. It provides card advantage and
    makes your threats extremely hard to deal with due to the limited amount of
    instant speed removal currently in the format. A turn 4 hasty 5/5 or 6/6 
    Woodland Wanderer is very hard to beat. Follow it up with another hasty 
    creature turn 5 and you're already on the way to winning. It will also keep
    your hand full and the threats coming, forcing your opponent to burn out 
    their removal quickly. 

I almost always win when I'm able to land a turn 3 Ascendancy, especially 
because enchantment removal is pretty rare in the format currently. 

Creatures

  * 
    Thunderbreak Regent: A 4/4 evasive creature with lightning strike built in 
    is always a good thing. It also provides some air defense (although this 
    deck is rarely on the defensive by turn 4). Also enables the bonus on 
    Draconic Roar, although Roar is good regardless. 
  * 
    Woodland Wanderer: He is why I built the deck. IMO, Wanderer's only 
    weakness is lack of haste. You give him that and he just destroys all other
    4-drops easily. Playing him also turns starts the comeback vs. fast aggro, 
    as he provides both amazing defense and offense. He's a planeswalker/token 
    murderer. Smash! 
  * 
    Thought-Knot Seer: I am still on the fence about this guy, but I think he 
    beats the alternatives of Savage Knuckleblade (faster but easily chumped) 
    and Skyrider Elf (Scale-able evasion, but lackluster p/t). He doesn't have 
    the evasion that this deck loves, but the hand disruption can sometimes be 
    vital. 
  * 
    Reality Smasher: Second favorite creature after Woodland Wanderer. This guy
    is nuts. The haste is sometimes redundant and sometimes not, but trample 
    and being hard to remove make this very hard to deal with. It quickly 
    closes out games. 

Spells

  * 
    Crater's Claws: This belongs in every Temur deck. Clears away early threats
    and the ferocious is very easy to activate. Fairly common to dome the 
    opponent for 6 or more late game. If control or, more commonly, ramp, 
    manages to stabilize a the last moment, finish them off by giving them the 
    claw!
  * 
    Draconic Roar: Efficient early removal for Jace and all those fast aggro 
    threats. 
  * 
    Radiant Flames: Yes, it is mainboard, but I find this card essential to 
    beating fast aggro Game 1. It misses all of my own creatures and can be 
    stacked with Roar or Claws to knock out larger threats. 
  * 
    Stubborn Denial: Another card that always makes sense in Temur. Ferocious 
    is easily activated and offers some mb protection. 

Lands

I am no mana guru, but I tried to make the land base as consistent as possible,
while providing ample colorless sources for Thought-Knot and Reality Smasher. I
needed a 4th color for Wanderer, so I decided to splash white for DL Dromoka. 
Not sure if this is the right move, but it seems to work so far! 

Sideboard

I am pretty unsure about most of the sideboard, but all of the cards have been 
useful so far. 

  * 
    Icefall Regent: Good vs. midrange and control. I'm still testing how it 
    compares to the other threats.
  * 
    DL Dromoka: Great vs. midrange and control. 
  * 
    Radiant Flames: All-star vs. aggro. 
  * 
    Icy Blast: My favorite spell in the deck. It can be useful as a 1 or 2 of 
    vs. fast aggro, but really shines vs. midrange where there are threats that
    can put up a fight vs. Temur (Rhino, Smasher, Tasigur, etc). Take out 
    blockers for one turn and the opponent is in trouble. Take them out for 2 
    turns with Ferocious, and they are dead. 
  * 
    Spell Shrivel: I don't know if this is the best counterspell for the deck 
    after Stubborn Denial and Disdainful Stroke, but I like that it counters 
    everything, exiles, and isn't hard on the early land base. I bring it in 
    vs. spell heavy decks, ramp, control, and midrange. 
  * 
    Pulse of Murasa: Is this good? I feel like it is good. I've always been 
    bothered by Feed the Clan, since giving myself life just seems so ... 
    boring. Pulse not only gives life, but returns a creature (and all the 
    creatures are good). It can also help smooth out the mana base. Being an 
    instant is extremely important, as it allows me to hold up counterspells 
    and use this as an eot alternative. 
  * 
    Disdainful Stroke: Great vs. Ramp. Not for countering the big threats, but 
    for countering the ramp spells. Ascendancy + big creatures usually kills 
    ramp before they can cast anything big. 

What do you guys think? I've been trying to make Ascendancy work for months, 
and I think that this might be the best standard for it now that Dromoka's 
Command is seeing less play and instant speed removal is scarce. It is slow vs.
aggro, but can remove early threats easily, and fast vs. control and ramp. And 
it's virtually chump block proof! All suggestions welcome!
